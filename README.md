# AB-TOH-PADHLE
**ü§ñüìö Textbook Chatbot**

This project is a chatbot designed to assist students in interacting with their textbooks in a conversational manner. The chatbot has been developed using the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model, which enables it to understand and respond to natural language queries. It can be run locally on a machine using LM Studio or accessed via the internet using the Hugging Face API.

**üåê Features:**

* *Select a textbook of your choice and initiate a conversation with it.*
* *Accessible via a user-friendly interface created with Streamlit.*
* *Contains chat memory: reponse of each chat is based on previous chats.*
* *View chat history to keep track of conversations.*
* *Select LLM of your own.*
* *Runs on both local machine and via internet.*
